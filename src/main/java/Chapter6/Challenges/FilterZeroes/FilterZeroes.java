/*
stream notes...
streams are a feature added in java to allow us to manipulate individual items in an array
or collection with a lambda function..
they contain some useful methods ..
filter, map (applies some change to each item), foreach (executes some action for each item,
like printing, for instance), collect (turns the stream into a collection, like a list or set)
