     * Let's try writing a for loop at the 'code here' point...
     *     for loops have several parts:
     *     1. we can declare some variable (by convention, called i, j, or k)
     *     2. we can define a condition that must be met for the code within the block to run (usually to do with the variable)
     *     3. we can define some operation that happens at the end of that block (usually incrementing/decrementing i)
     *
     *     let's try it:
     *     for the first part, write
     *         int i = start;
     *     for the second part, write
     *         i < end;
     *     for the third part, write
     *         i++;
     *     within the for loop block, let's have the following code:
     *         sum = sum + i;
     *     this will add the current value of i to an already existing variable 'sum', so that we can get the sum of
     *     all numbers that fall between start and end.
     *     you can consult any for loop example to resolve syntax issues.
     *
     * @param start the value of i where the for loop should start.
     * @param end the value of i where the for loop should end (provided that the for loop is incremented with i++)
     * @return the sum of all numbers between start and end, with start inclusive and end exclusive.
