    /**
     * This is a research problem! FileIO requires a number of moving parts, but is also an interesting problem
     * on its own.
     * Read a single line from a file. You will need to look up how to read a file in Java and interpret the code you
     * find such that you can write a working method.
     *
     * @param filepath the path, relative to your project folder's location, of the files to be read.
     *                 Files used in testing are provided in the repo under src/main/resources/files.
     *                 example filepath: "src/main/resources/Files/HelloFile1.txt"
     * @return the first read from the file (the test cases only test based off of 1-line files.)
     * @throws FileNotFoundException    Java needs to be prepared for the possibility that a file does not exist. In
     *                                  that instance, this method is prepared to throw an exception, which may
     *                                  lead to crashing our program.
