package Chapter7.Challenges.Cipher;
/*
This caesar cipher shifts all letters by n steps,
eg
abc
becomes
bcd

be careful about letters at the end of the alphabet wrapping around to the beginning!
remember that you can use charAt to get chars and that chars are stored as numbers that you
can perform math on,
as well as the % operator which allows you to get the remainder after division..
good luck
