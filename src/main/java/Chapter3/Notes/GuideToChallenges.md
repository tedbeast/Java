# Guide to Coding Challenges

Coding challenges are a trained skill that takes months to improve on. They are not a reflection of someone's ability to develop software, but are an approximation of problem solving skill that can be trained, kind of like chess. As a result, many interviews feature a coding challenge. Interviews with Revature that have coding challenge are usually at the difficulty of those in chapters 5-6. Many of the challenges are taken straight from real interviews. Regardless of initial skill level, everyone should be able to solve a level 2 difficulty challenge within 10 minutes by the end of the training.

## How to solve coding challenges

You may notice that the challenges require a different skillset than the core language problems. Whereas the core questions are a product of research, a challenge follows an introspective format. If you find the process of solving a challenge difficult, consider this advice:
* identify the format of the input, and the format of the output
    * What sort of information do I get, and what sort should I return? Within Java, we have to keep our types consistent: for these challenges, you should never have to change the return type of a method.
* ask yourself, "how does a human solve this problem?"
    * Humans do not just 'solve' problems. Even for the simplest level-1 problems, there is a definite set of instructions that people can use to solve the problem. For any problem you find challenging, imagine this: you have to solve the same problem, but all you have access to is pencil and paper, and the input size is large (eg a list of a thousand numbers or a word with a thousand letters). Imagine that you are asked to meticulously describe the process to another human without them knowing what the original objective is. If you are descriptive enough, converting the solution to code is just a matter of understanding syntax, which will you will get through practice.
* understand the test cases
    * Reading through the test cases may help you plan your code, especially if you have a mix of passes/fails. Note that with many challenges, there will be a couple cases that pass without your own implementation, because the method stub of the challenge may just return a 0, false, empty string, etc.
* use the debugger tool
    * By creating a breakpoint and using the debugger, you can examine what values your variables contain every time the breakpoint is passed. This is very useful to place within loops.
* do not change the test cases
    * no.

Please remember that you learn nothing and gain nothing from copying solutions into your IDE. Yes, I know that you are doing it.

All the best
