you will recieve a 2d array of booleans. The booleans represent if there is a link between to vertices [x][y] on a network
(referred to as a graph officially). We will say that vertices are marked as connected to themselves on a graph, so
[x][x] is always true.
Your task is to determine if all elements are connected by some path to each other, or if the 2d array represents
multiple graphs that are disjoint from each other.
