 * Let's finish up our number-related challenges by creating a little game for users to play - for instance,
 * we could a game where the player is asked to name a number such as pi, 3.14.
 *
 * There is no need to change anything in this class. It does not affect the outcome of the test cases.
 * The purpose of this class is for you to interact with a functional Console Line menu, so that you can
 * see how your code works from the user's end.
